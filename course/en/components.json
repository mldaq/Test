He uses it for quick access to practical advice using how-to videos on YouTube.</p><p>Franks married&nbsp;to Joan, who when she&#39;s not out and about in her job as a midwife, is always busy planning the family&#39;s next getaway. She&#39;s doing a Spanish language course using a Duolingo app. She tries to do at least one exercise each day to build up her skills in advance of this summer&#39;s trip to Minorca. She&#39;s determined that at least one of them should speak some of the lingo.</p><p>Belinda is Frank and Joan&#39;s oldest child she&#39;s been working in a bank now for five years and has determined to progress quickly up the ladder. She&#39;s doing an online MBA&nbsp;course. Currently, she&#39;s participating in a business game with hundreds of other students worldwide to support her in the game. She has access to dozens of short tutorials which provided insights into aspects of business finance.</p><p>Lastly, there&#39;s Sed, Belinda&#39;s brother he was learning to be a plumber this involves him going into college for day each week in between. He&#39;s designed lots of short modules to work through on his own covering all sorts of technical subjects.</p><p>[Music]</p><p>Although they may not know it, all of the O&#39;Connell&#39;s are benefiting from the joys of micro learning - self-directed learning delivered in small chunks. Frank uses YouTube as a form of performance support to help him carry out his DIY task. Joan uses her Duolingo app for regular spaced practice of her Spanish language skills. Belinda uses short modules to provide her with support as and when she needs it, as she immerses herself in a more major learning task the online business game. And&nbsp;Sed, is assigned self-study content to complete as part of a blended solution that makes up this college course in plumbing.</p><p>Four ways in which micro learning helps the O&#39;Connell&#39;s and increasing numbers of people all over the world to achieve their learning goals and get the job done day in day out.</p><p>[Music]&nbsp;</p>",
